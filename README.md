# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazin Vine Program. That program is designed to allow manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. What companies do, is they pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, that are required to publish a review. Throughout this analysis, we will be working wuth PySparl, PgAdmin, Google Colab, Pandas and SQL.

## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.

Overall, I do not think there were any bias shown for the reviews in the Vine Program because there was not a drastic difference in the total 5-star percentage between both Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews. It just seems that Vine reviews are just more critical when it comes to creatinga review compared to the non-Vine reviews.
